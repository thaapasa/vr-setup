# HP Reverb G2 extended

## Index Controllers

Original instructions: https://github.com/PumkinSpice/MixedVR/wiki/ReadMe?utm_source=pocket_mylist

Note: OpenVR Space Calibrator should only be needed when using the tracking
provided by WMR (i.e., the Reverb G2 HMD). If you use Vive Tracker with the
G2, then it should not be needed.

## MixedVR Manager

See https://github.com/monstermac77/vr#MixedVR-Manager

Install this for some automatic environment management (shutting down WMR / base stations etc. automatically).
